This server-only facet uses node-specific functionality to create an HTTP server on port 3000. It uses the operating system to server-render its GUI as a single HTML element with inlined CSS and JavaScript. This acts as a bootstrap which fetches and installs the operating system a service worker.

When it is deployed as the main node module (and not imported by another module) it gathers information about other version deployments and can serve them by importing them as modules.

It provides http-to-https redirects, ensures that the "www." subdomain is always present, redirects from canonical URLs, provides version information for the update manager, and redirects certain canonical paths (like "/") to the appropriate versioned and stateful counterpart.
