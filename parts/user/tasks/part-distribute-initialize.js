I need to assign a fixed cardinality limit to the set.

This will be done functionally ... any change to data size must occur in the window. The window presents the warnings and errors for file size.

This can be accomplished using the abstraction of a tiny "drive".

The drive contents literally *drive* everything the system displays.

The drive determines the moment.

The drive aught to be able to contain a myriad of files and folders
 but what does a folder do in terms of task action?

Tasks are typically a non-nested group of files.

Nesting would be ... difficult. Mathematically, that would be highly intricate.

One way to do it might be a simple base-3 system:
open. slot. close

However, this has issues.

Let us try a method: sort a list of possible arrangements in a linear way.
