## The build process outputs `api/service.js` but Vercel looks for serverless
## functions before it runs the build process. An empty placeholder was pushed
## to the remote repository and the file is assumed unchanged during the local
## build. Undo using `git update-index --no-assume-unchanged api/service.js`.
