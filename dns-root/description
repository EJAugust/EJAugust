This part represents the root of the Domain Name System within the platform's part hierarchy. Its domain name is the empty string (""), and all of its subparts are top-level domains (TLDs) like ".com" and ".io".

It forms the root of the runtime state space used to compute a two-way minimal perfect hash function (MPHF) across all hosted applications. When serialized, it inlines all metadata and file structure compiled from the repository at build time.

It is automatically assigned a semantic version number which acts as the version number of the MPHF as a whole.
