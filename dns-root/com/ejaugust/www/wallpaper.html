  <p>Hello. This is my first development note.</p>
  <p>It took a <i>long</i> time to post this one because I had to build a framework first.</p>
  <p>This framework will allow me to easily share my thoughts, progress, and discoveries as I continue my development
   journey. I'm excited to finally have a place to document and share what I'm learning and building.</p>
  <p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

  <p>Here's a small example of some inline code: <code>const message = "Hello!";</code></p>
  <pre><code>function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
</code></pre>

  <p>This is just the beginning. I have many more ideas and projects in the pipeline. Thanks for reading!</p>
