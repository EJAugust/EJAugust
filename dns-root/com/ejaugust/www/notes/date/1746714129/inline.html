<p>This is the thrilling sequel to My First Note. I created it to demonstrate this platform's ability to store the state of arbitrary, nested subcomponents within the overall stateful application.</p>
<p>Go ahead and open up some FAQ sections, below. They are stateful. You'll be able to bookmark or share a link to this page (or copy the URL and paste it into another tab or refresh the page). The state of this application will still be retained.</p>
<p>You can also use the menu at the bottom left of the screen to go to another application. When you come back, things here should be just how you left them.</p>
<p>No local storage, cookies, cache or backend is used to remember each state. The URL in the addressbar is doing all the heavy lifting. It stores the state and, because it goes with you as you navigate to different apps, it brings the state of _this_ application everywhere it goes.</p>
<p>Like a little briefcase. ðŸ’¼</p>
