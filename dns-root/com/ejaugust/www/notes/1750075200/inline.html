<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank">Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</a> is an app that provides tools to streamline the development of other apps.</p>
<p>Last week, I published a note about the multiverse metaphor for software engineering. This is a metaphor that explains the difference between explains the difference between using an app and editing the app live.</p>
<p>In case you didn't see it, here's a refresher:</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>When you use the IDE to build an application, you can think of that as navigating the IDE's state. You're <em>navigating the known universe.</em> üßë‚Äçüíª</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>When you use that IDE to change its own source code, you can think of that as changing the laws of physics for the IDE. The available state space changes. You're <em>navigating the multiverse.</em> üßë‚ÄçüöÄ üöÄ</p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>But what do we call an IDE that has everything you need to modify its own code while it's still running? Let's call it: a <em>Universal Integrated Development Environment (UIDE) </em>because it can, in theory, be transformed into whatever you need it to be.</p>
<p>A UIDE is an application that lets you explore the multiverse like a starship captain. Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<h2>SDKs and Package Managers Aren't Fun</h2>
<p>Imagine that exploring the multiverse meant opening a terminal window, installing some third party package managers, fixing a bunch of issues, and typing a bunch of code in an editor that looks like <em>this</em>:</p>
<figure>

 <figcaption class="image-caption">Does this make you feel like Captain Kirk?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>This</em> is not the UIDE of my dreams.</p>
<p>The universe is a <em>grand place</em>, the <em>multiverse</em> perhaps more so. Exploring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFbuxleCu2k" target="_blank">strange new worlds</a> should be a stunning, gratifying experience. What we need is something <em>fun</em>, something<em> immersive.</em> What we need is a <em>Gamified </em>Universal Integrated Development Environment - a <em>GUIDE</em>.<br></p>
<h3>Adding Gems Doesn't Make It Fun</h3>
<p>Increasingly, designers are seeing the need for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification#Technology_design" target="_blank">gameplay features in order to add intrinsic value</a> to their applications.</p>
<p>Many serious applications (including <em>workplace</em> applications) now include fictional currency (<em>You just got 10 Gems!</em>, <em>Invite a friend to earn 5 Coins</em>), badges (<em>Top Contributor</em>, <em>5 Day Streak!</em>) and confetti every time you ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just me, but those things aren't enough to make an app fun all by themselves. They've been used as a bandaid for tedious (and at times, downright exploitative) user experiences, so I've already learned to associate them with tedium.</p>

<h2>My Dream <em>GUIDE</em></h2>
<p>Those things aren't what I crave in a game. It's the <em>story</em>, the <em>characters,</em> the <em>exploration</em>, the <em>creativity</em>, and perhaps even some <em>crazy physics.</em></p>
<p>That's what gets my blood pumping.</p>
<p>That's what drew me to the sci-fi classics ‚Äî Star Trek, Stargate, Star Wars, etc. and that's also what drew me to writing this note.</p>
<p>Imagine a game that wasn't trying to cover up that it's secretly an <em>IDE</em> as much as it was trying to just be a game.</p>
<p>But this game lets the community <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding" target="_blank">create and play mods</a> for it, from within the game, without having to close the game.</p>
<p>This concept is a bit like a desktop operating system. You can change the behavior of it by adding, modifying and removing system files. You can often see these changes reflected even without shutting the computer down.</p>
<p>I get an unusual amount of joy from playing around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1" target="_blank">vintage operating systems</a>. For me, they already are a kind of game. But I'm willing to admit that this isn't everybody's cup of tea. By gamifying the operating system, we can nurture a diverse group of contributors who will take the game to the next level.</p>
<h3>Next-Level Sandbox Game</h3>
<p>There are already some fantastic precedents for turning art, architecture, design and engineering into an engaging and collaborative gameplay experience - exactly what I want my GUIDE to be able to do.</p>
<p>One of my favorite examples of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>. In that game, players get to break their world into small parts and reassemble them however they want. <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Redstone_Dust" target="_blank">Redstone</a> allows players to create circuits and machines which can automate complex tasks.</p>
<p>Fans of Minecraft have done some amazing things with it. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=redstone+engineering" target="_blank">quick search on YouTube</a> will show you mind-boggling creations, including low-level engineering (like making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gBZHXqnleU" target="_blank">working computers</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_game" target="_blank">Sandbox games</a> are fun, but you can't edit the source code of the Minecraft executable by placing redstone. As a software architect, what I really want is a game that directly maps its fictional technology and narrative structure to the game's <em>real </em>source code and development methodology - and then lets me engage with those things at <em>native</em> speed.</p>
<p>Dare I say‚Ä¶ <em>warp</em> speed.</p>
<h3>A Familiar Danger</h3>
<p>A good game usually has at least a little bit of danger. In Minecraft, depending on the difficulty, <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Mob#Hostile_mobs" target="_blank">hostile mobs</a> will spawn, attack the player and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TTR6W6B43U" target="_blank">destroy their hard work</a>.</p>
<p>In general, desktop computer users already know that they shouldn't modify and delete system files unless they know what they're doing. The machine might <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_(computing)" target="_blank">hang forever</a></em>, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_(computing)" target="_blank">crash</a></em>, <em>get stuck in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting#Bootloop" target="_blank">boot loop</a>, </em>or even <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)" target="_blank">become a brick</a></em>.</p>
<p>We could add enemies into the GUIDE, but we don't actually need to. Changing the code of an app while it's still running is like a surgeon operating on themself. The GUIDE is not <em>in</em> danger. It <em>is</em> the danger.</p>
<p>(Thankfully, its <em>just a game.)</em></p>
<h3>Back to the Multiverse</h3>
<p>In addition to helping users understand the two kinds of change that can take place in the app, the multiverse metaphor also helps because:</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>It's a compelling tie-in to a fictional narrative - more so than <em>file folders</em>.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>The <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Immaterium" target="_blank">risks and rewards</a> are baked into our cultural consciousness.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>Its an all encompassing metaphor that is just begging to have all of its extensions mapped out.</p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>There aren't a lot of movies about the risks of importing the wrong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit" target="_blank">third-party SDK</a> into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git" target="_blank">git</a> repository. There are a lot of movies about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_and_the_Wasp:_Quantumania" target="_blank">playing around with the universe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fly_(1986_film)" target="_blank">the dangers</a> of toying with science and technology.</p>
<h3>You Are the Hero</h3>
<p>Picture this.</p>
<p>You've just arrived at a massive, high-tech research facility.</p>
<p>Everybody's glad you're here - they <em>need</em> your help to operate the giant, mysterious<em> </em>machine they built.</p>
<p>Everything about the facility demands exploration, but the shot callers are waiting for you in the briefing room.</p>
<p>There's an air of mystery and a bit of suspense as you make your way there.</p>
<p>That's when they tell you just what this machine is capable of.</p>
<p>It's a doorway to the <em>multiverse.</em></p>
<p>And <em>you're</em> going to be the one that pilots it.</p>
<h4>‚ÄúThis facility is divided into three sections.‚Äù</h4>
<p>You find out that the research facility you work at is broken into three major sections.</p>
<p>You start out in Section 1 - a study area for new hires. Here, you'll prove that you can fix a few broken things and enhance a few other things and you earn your way to Section 2.</p>
<p>Section 2 introduces you to experimental devices that let you to control time and space - within a sandbox. You can go into that sandbox as an avatar, like the <a href="https://assassinscreed.fandom.com/wiki/Animus" target="_blank">Animus in Assassins Creed</a>. The outside world is shielded from the effects of your work, in case you make a mistake.</p>
<p>You make people. You make fictional creatures. You bring historical figures to life. All the while, you hear whispers about the top secret work they're doing in Section 3‚Ä¶</p>
<h4>Welcome to Section 3 - Where The Sky is the Limit</h4>
<p>One day you're approached by a mysterious man. It turns out, he's the facilities manager for Section 3. They know about you in Section 3. In fact, you've been recruited for a special project there.</p>
<p>As soon as you arrive, a new world opens up. All across the walls are giant banners that say ‚ÄúThe sky is the limit!‚Äù</p>
<p>To your right you see a 2 acre terrarium filled with dinosaurs.</p>
<p>To your left you see creatures from another world coming through a portal.</p>
<p>Before you know what's going on, a 12-legged robot climbs over the top of you</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have to be careful where you're going down here‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúAfter all, the sky is the limit.‚Äù</p>
<p>You learn to bring your creations out of the sandbox and into the real world. You bring imaginary animals, plants, vehicles and technology and out of the sandbox. After you <a href="https://www.halopedia.org/Forge" target="_blank">forge</a> your own research office, you move on to having bigger and bigger lab space and more and more dangerous reality-editing tools.</p>
<p>At this point, you're modifying the <em>research facility itself</em>. In regards to the code base of the game, you're replacing the art assets of the facility. You're making your own 3D models, rigs and animations. You're changing where NPCs spawn, making your own trigger volumes, and creating your own particle effects.</p>
<p>In short order, you find yourself in charge. You are now <em>running all of section 3.</em></p>
<p>But one thing keeps nagging you and you finally decide to ask the Section 3 facility manager.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy do you always say that the sky is the limit?‚Äù</p>
<p>He takes you up the elevator back outside the facility. ‚ÄúSee the sky up there?‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe have a lot of great technology in section 3. But we don't have a machine that can change that sky.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat machine,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúis down in Section 4.‚Äù</p>
<h4>The Growth Never Ends</h4>
<p>One of the most important aspects to making a game fun is about balancing its pacing. The difficulty has to ramp up to meet the player's performance. The same is true about education. In fact, that's what a challenging, well-paced game is doing - it's teaching gameplay mechanics to players who started completely from scratch.</p>
<p>In the GUIDE, those mechanics are software engineering mechanics.</p>
<p>The ideal narrative is one that provides players with a <em>ladder</em> - a journey that lets them advance one step at a time from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbie" target="_blank">newbie</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman" target="_blank">journeyman</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user" target="_blank">power user</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero" target="_blank">someone that can completely transform their world</a>.</p>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>It may require a little inspiration (and a lot of math) but I believe that creating such a GUIDE is both doable and worth doing.</p>
<p>The biggest challenges of this project are in creating a framework that can match 1:1 all of its actual software components with in-game fictional components and preventing malicious misuse.</p>
<p>For the last three years, I've been researching and developing a quantitative framework that I intend to accomplish exactly this. But it's not easy, and it takes time.</p>
<p>But here's the coolest thing about a <em>UIDE</em>‚Ä¶</p>
<h3>The Power of Continuous Improvement</h3>
<p>One more time, lets bring back our sad-looking, UIDE image from earlier:</p>
<figure>

  <img src="#" alt="The very boring user interface, again." title="The very boring user interface, again.">
 </picture>
 <figcaption>Welcome to Trury Doarring Surd Clole. The <em>first</em> thing we'll change is the name.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'll admit, this doesn't look like much, but it might be <em>enough</em> to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>After all, the whole idea behind a UIDE is that we can instantly start trial-and-error development with it. Just as soon as we have version 1.0.0, we can rapidly prototype version 2.0.0 <em>without closing version 1.0.0.</em></p>
<p>It <em>will</em> crash. Work <em>will</em> get lost, especially in the early days. The entire code base may need to be refactored <em>again and again</em> before our <em>UIDE</em> becomes a bona fide (fun) <em>GUIDE</em>.</p>
<p>They say the sky is the limit. But with a <em>GUIDE</em>, if you don't like the sky, you can replace it with something else.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading. My dream is to make software engineering easy and accessible to <em>everyone</em>. All of my work goes directly into making that happen, including this note.</p>
<p>I hope these ideas make you as excited as I am. I hope it inspires you to explore operating systems, software engineering and gamification,.</p>
<p>I'm excited to take these metaphors to the next level.</p>
<p>I'm excited to take <em>software development</em> to the next level.</p>
<p>I look forward to writing more soon!</p>
