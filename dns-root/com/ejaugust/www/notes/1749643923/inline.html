<p>This demonstrates a convenient feature in JavaScript whereby a string is automatically casted to a number, thanks to the increment and decrement operations.</p>
<h2>Initial State</h2>
<p>Here, we have six variables which will help demonstrate the effect for us.</p>
<pre>let a = "2"
let b = "2"
let c = "2"
let d = "2.14159"
let e = "Euler's number is not 2.14159"
let f = "2.14159 is not Euler's number"</pre>
<p>Naturally, the <code>typeof</code> all four is <code>"string"</code>.</p>
<h2>Adding a Number to an Obvious Integer String</h2>
<p>Here, we'll add a number directly to <code>a</code> using <code>a += 1</code>.</p>
<section id="w">
 <pre><b>a === </b>"21"<br><b>typeof a === </b>"string"</pre>
</section>
<p>This did the opposite of what we wanted. We wanted to convert the string to a number and increase it by one, but this converted the one to a string and concatenated it to <code>a</code>.</p>
<h2>Using Increment and Decrement on Integer Strings</h2>
<p>Next, we'll change <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> by incrementing one and decrementing the other (<code>b++</code> and <code>c--</code>).</p>
<section id="x">
 <pre><b>b === </b>3<br><b>typeof b === </b>"number"</pre>
 <pre><b>c === </b>1<br><b>typeof c === </b>"number"</pre>
</section>
<p>This is the result we were after.</p>
<p>Now, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> have both changed from their original value of <code>"2"</code>.</p>
<p>One went up, and one went down.</p>
<p>From this point on, the type of both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> is now <code>number</code>.</p>
<h2>What Happens to Float strings?</h2>
<p>Next, we'll try to do the same thing to <code>d</code>, a string that looks like it could be a floating point value, using <code>d++</code>.</p>
<section id="y">
 <pre><b>d === </b>3.14159<br><b>typeof d === </b>"number"</pre>
</section>
<p>It worked! JavaScript automatically parsed the float value for us and then increased it.</p>
<h2>What Happens to Non-Numeric Strings?</h2>
<p>Finally, we'll try the same trick on <code>e</code> and <code>f</code> to see what happens.</p>
<section id="z">
 <pre><b>e === </b>NaN<br><b>typeof e === </b>"number"</pre>
 <pre><b>f === </b>NaN<br><b>typeof f === </b>"number"</pre>
</section>
<p>As you can see, both cases created the infamous <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN">NaN</a>.</p>
