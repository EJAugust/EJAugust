This match reads the six common color swatches that the current application provides as its color scheme and computes a wide array of shades and colors – some relative to the color mode and some absolute – in order to provide a consistent color interface. It also provides a switch between three different color modes: dark, light and device. Crucially, device includes special handling and callbacks in case the user's device color mode changes.
