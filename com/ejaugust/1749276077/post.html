<p>For the past three years I’ve been trying to build an operating system that can do everything you expect an operating system to do while also encoding its entire state as a single URI. That way, we get a permalink to every state and achieve truly comprehensive deep linking.</p>
<p>For a long time, I struggled with finding a solid approach to achieving this goal. A user-friendly operating system involves many independent, dependent and otherwise tightly coupled components - especially when you want it to be a platform that supports third-party app development. I tried a variety of different methods to store that data in a URI without any redundancy.</p>
<p>Some of my attempts involved query parameters, some of them base64 encoded JSON objects, some of them domain-specific languages and some of them my own custom syntax. They all had the same problem - they failed to capitalize on the <i>actual space available in URIs</i>.</p>
<p>An incredible combinatorial explosion appears when you try to compute the number of unique URIs that can exist. Query params, JSON objects, domain-specific languages and any other syntax will always suffer from the same problem: it encodes duplicate information and requires delimiters that take up space in the URI.</p>
<h2>The URI Space: Bigger Than the Universe</h2>
<p>According to some very lazy research I just did, the estimated number of particles in the observable universe is 1096. That’s a 97-digit number. Even though that’s an unfathomably large number (imagine having to count to it), its not <i>that</i> long. Have a look:</p>
<pre>1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</pre>
<p>It barely fills two lines of text on my monitor.</p>
<p>If you could assign a unique natural number (or <i>hash</i>) to every particle in the known universe you’d never need more than 97 digits to do it.</p>
<p>If we change the base from 10 to 64, 1096 is less than 6454. That means you never need more than 54 characters to assign a unique base 64 hash to every particle in the known universe.</p>
<p>That’s an incredibly short string of text for such a big feat. Here’s a sample I made by mashing my keyboard 54 times:</p>
<pre>09m84COSM84wf897hos_t83740FW3M-8tdocs8374tyvsc9nc3b1nt</pre>
<p>In theory, this could be the URI of a random particle in the universe. Hopefully, it’s one close by.</p>
<p>This kind of assignment, where each element in a set has an integer value and there are no gaps or collisions, is called a minimal perfect hash function (MPHF).</p>
<p>Of course, URIs have a more structured syntax than base64 integers. For example, the domain name takes up a little bit of space in the address bar and you don’t normally encode numerical data in a domain name.</p>
<p>Yet, even if we add the longest possible domain name (255 characters)…</p>
<pre>https://heres.a.huge.domain.name.as.long.as.it.can.possibly.be.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.example.com/9m84COSM84wf897hos_t83740FW3M-8tdocs8374tyvsc9nc3b1nt</pre>
<p>… we still use only 317 characters, and this is the worst-case domain name. We know that URIs can be far longer than this. For example, here is the URI I get when I search Google for pictures for cats:</p>
<pre>https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=c99a67a28e4a9644&q=cats&udm=2&fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeioyp3OhN11EY0n5qfq-zENwnGygERInUV_0g0XKeHGJtesk9Adz8V_3dCFxRHd-4rVc28Hvas3fJjxYa4l0bNk99rKkfyreU5lHIQnHuafulMAL-Uqa-w7l2q-jrp2K_DA_pRuYwavY1buYjWGJpBAMTtrbI6TDhEB-GyDqzxOrfIfwCQ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQhOe9hd6NAxVRRjABHUCvJ6oQtKgLegQIGRAB&biw=1223&bih=754&dpr=2</pre>
<p>Back when Internet Explorer was popular, URIs were allowed to have <i>thousands</i> of characters. Today, they can have <i>millions</i>.</p>
<h3>TL; DR:</h3>
<p>Based on current estimates, <b>there are far more unique URIs than there are particles in the known universe</b>. This had me thinking: how can a web app capitalize on all of that storage space?</p>
<h2>How many possible URIs are there?</h2>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>To determine the actual cardinality of that set you’d need to make a few assumptions. For example, are consecutive slashes allowed or will they be normalized away? Do we limit it to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/maximum-url-length-is-2-083-characters-in-internet-explorer-174e7c8a-6666-f4e0-6fd6-908b53c12246#:~:text=Microsoft%20Internet%20Explorer%20has%20a,request%20and%20GET%20request%20URLs." target="_blank">two thousand characters like Internet Explorer</a> or <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/url_display_guidelines/url_display_guidelines.md#:~:text=Chrome%20limits%20URLs%20to%20a,is%20used%20on%20VR%20platforms." target="_blank">two million like Chrome</a>?</p>
<p>Lets go factor-by-factor and, at each step, we’ll assume the worst possible case.</p>
<h3>Worst-Case Length</h3>
<p>First, we start with the length. Let’s use a hard limit of 2000 characters. Since Chrome supports 2MB, we just <em>removed 99.9% of the URIs from our set</em>. Even so, there is still a lot of nuance to computing the cardinality of that <em>remaining 0.1%</em>.</p>
<h3>No Protocol Mutability</h3>
<p>For the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.1" target="_blank">scheme/protocol</a>, forget about any cardinality imparted by that. I only want to think about secure browsing contexts (“https://”). We subtract those 8 characters, leaving us with 1992 characters.</p>
<h3>Worst Possible Host</h3>
<p>What about the host name? Well, what’s the worst case we could possibly run in to?</p>
<p>Many projects and apps are meant to exist on only one origin, so lets not even allow any mutability in the host.</p>
<p>The maximum length of a host name is 255-characters. So let’s bring back that behemoth of a domain that I showed earlier:</p>
<pre>https://heres.a.huge.domain.name.as.long.as.it.can.possibly.be.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.example.com</pre>
<p>Just to be clear, we removed every URI from our set that doesn’t have this domain name which, as you know, was pretty much <em>all of them</em>. Yet, we’re still left with 1737 characters we can store data in.</p>
<h3>No Optional Features</h3>
<p>There’s still a lot of unpredictability in the size of our set, however. For example, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.1" target="_blank">user credentials</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.3" target="_blank">port</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.4" target="_blank">query/search parameters</a>, and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.5" target="_blank">hash/fragment</a> all add a ton of cardinality to our set but they also add an incredible amount of complexity to the cardinality equation.</p>
<p>Luckily, they’re all optional. We’ll just remove all of the URIs that have these features (which, if you didn’t know, was almost <em>all of the URIs we had left</em>).</p>
<h3>No Variable-length Pathnames</h3>
<p>At this point, we’re really just counting the set of all valid <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.3" target="_blank">pathnames</a> up to 1737 characters long. All pathnames require at least the initial slash and the empty pathname without an initial slash will often resolve to one with it or vice versa. So, that first pathname character is already useless.</p>
<p>Furthermore, how do we account for the variable-length of pathnames? We’d have to add the number of 2-character pathnames to the number of 3-character pathnames to the number of 4-character pathnames and so on.</p>
<p>To compute that, we require a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series" target="_blank">geometric series</a>. That’s too rich for my blood, so lets just remove <em>every URI whose pathname is not exactly 1737 characters long</em>. Again, we just removed almost every URI from our already stripped-down set.</p>
<h3>No Special Characters</h3>
<p>URI pathnames support 76+ characters (once you include the percent symbol, comma, period, exclamation point, etc.), suggesting it <em>might</em> be possible to approach base 76.</p>
<p>Sadly, though, many of these special symbol combinations will get stripped away/normalized down to others during URI resolution. Others will cause an error if used incorrectly. It isn’t trivial to compute the cardinality of that.</p>
<p>The solution? You guessed it. We’ll remove most of the URIs from our set! Let’s only consider URIs that use the following 64 character alphabet to spell out their pathname segments:</p>
<pre>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-_</pre>
<p>But we can’t just string together 1737 of these bad boys and call it a day…</p>
<h3>No Variable-length Segments</h3>
<p>A valid URI pathname can be broken up into segments, each separated by a forward slash. Some systems throw an error if even one of those segments is longer than 250 characters. It wouldn’t be terribly hard to account for these arrangements but it <em>would</em> mean writing out a geometric series.</p>
<p>So, lets only count URLs that have this exact arrangement:</p>
<p>Seven fixed-length segments: six 250-character segments followed by one 230 character segment.</p>
<p>This requires seven slashes to split it all up; 1737 minus 7 leaves us with an even 1730 segment characters.</p>
<p>Not to sound like a broken record, but almost none of the URIs in our set had this exact arrangement. We just removed <em>almost everything we had left, yet again</em>.</p>
<p>Just for fun, here is a “random” sample from our set:</p>

<p>I mashed my keyboard as fast as I could and didn’t bother adding any underscores or dashes, and it still took a surprisingly long time to type this out.</p>
<h3>Final Cardinality of our Set</h3>
<p>Our set is now a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of its former self. Every URI in our set is a highly unlikely 264-character origin followed by a just-as-unlikely arrangement of 1730 base-64 digits. Ultimately, what we’ve got here isn’t even a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>But the good news is we finally have a set that can be represented by a trivial cardinality expression! Here it is: <math><mi>k</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mn>64</mn><mn>1730</mn></msup></math></p>
<p>Remember how there are less than <math><msup><mn>64</mn><mn>54</mn></msup></math> particles in the known universe? Contrast that with <math><msup><mn>64</mn><mn>1730</mn></msup></math>. The ratio is basically 0:1. But what does our final number <em>look</em> like?</p>
<p>First, recall this number:</p>
<pre>1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</pre>
<p>You can hash <em>every particle in the universe</em> with this.</p>
<p>Now look at the number of URIs in our “tiny” worst-case set:</p>
<pre>49130930808458578125726405944552267433522803882142885516112811523788026785247859392846571767356697524778325967483200069078779474567637462287039820734625250499484361851684556510293931285640090262847320625396236411697500945066199598105166159939755919883442591852056298637720529199720593614665368213198995251597105758524900013562528183914971627692406189778877642149164166096666344310948740383560007413387592604328612531345115046683029331104462385525968171774813136492661946688877582952419371606080350664628677161116012681284900630454342749044599225617460538414933002793524748242310551996204900729123914340847332998493284864702610102439307491216408396209310348370320754399598907600619635495790019370265074821420291117076832510034388136166750175664483098298227108288715448223965251691403281034083780954570303916571362770718114444005072106144764849088939314984894581474809543833192044410395714190504825893726938138808786090562830615071943734645166593502644409746065788403640661934980709315726553694898120393882753330274852067296608154605846048350579895683801542722129840564975973695792574841807503188443209805038542236087627591190050313931573054215490244259112910601708234964741899698246055425592081845013246361046328159137214118378184713651023860908738930831971118247941416724345631434014423798305497398506349015730376483008110926005644593572237269397514131887446582215094604019679547368523447625105463951586910365216023840045751551948134564505146576477286926376308492310938786531574335304262217571479998838543109756673336971087025554889723823983924836021091907239786400390676746118864056643193205208982882660920507349524831913201182159186699144808760747505873640789216340957248824164601830737224297040770920458197407697184648022371257191918470172361380986595622828733829413281500185801880456613038104242643213822575569128878763680705643247394470467893917356297826947055879379566532902944043402022244021075932899192372571062439168957178821897773439784799153514401590031281325655093535268608362216209580429528935699708423114866509895772049714403629267974279109387816328548424345736717256948117015825744199080052425083293799967061771719865084133230904096721868612800747277569863102967441274245770550134896869196181886526475029674372524872538258468524762201586321646559863923236843242370292251062221529264770493701602901661815354058944472808349405810473671013491176811312485003537600785430597702027500137187545757793793903699970939444681886308707596870841054350202539644315500656737966010773075989351158870179723002367751683561878721860274497306669607424568652625472586573342936967070726864546132506261184714500488245623426076538010987701708241991726967647765104168030353744906806687895709021815045224257436600078097509507924968458836098125864106257805097776865485964770796555656543643860800587923743280926493394369557925897760397469072974966876141221188598603450443972539793912611469980053930814065772811818839300960781935055752799228266748050545969251447362299129060916916664278672204155214991658109636131883622892313180240750974195280013175415626930825404039290811759144500594703907940131918638449619062937500747268988899138994176</pre>
<p>That’s <em>a lot</em>. Imagine what you could hash with <em>this</em>!</p>
<p>In the case of my project, the “<em>things</em>" I need to hash are <em>application states</em>.</p>
<p><em>Do I really need this many application states to make an operating system?</em></p>
<p>My guess was <em>no way</em> (especially if I embrace a minimalist approach to UI interaction design).</p>
<p>However, to take full advantage of all of that storage space, I would need to create a MPHF that could integrate naturally into today’s web app technology stack.</p>
<h2>MVC + MPHF</h2>
<p>In addition to an MPHF, my project needed a reactive full-stack MVC framework. An application state needed to be recoverable from any hash, and vice-versa, so both the hash function and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function" target="_blank">its inverse function</a> had to actually exist and be computable (not just theoretically). Furthermore, it had to be fast - fast enough for real-time operating system interaction (at least 60 frames per second).</p>
<p>All of my math and programming knowledge is self-taught. Unfortunately, that means I sometimes come upon information in a less-than-ideal order. I filled several fat sketchbooks with graphs and notes and ended up creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_function" target="_blank">piecewise-defined</a> MPHF.</p>
<p>Yet, I only learned the term “perfect hash function” after I finished the algorithm. Had I studied perfect hashing functions at any point before this project, it would have shaved months off of the process.</p>
<p>My breakthrough came when I realized that the structure I was building to support the bijection had a surprising amount in common with MVC architecture. In fact, the two ended up laying right on top of each other and being the <em>same thing</em>.</p>
<p>Every MVC controller object is a piece of the piecewise-defined function. Whether you assign a hash (which acts as the data model) to a controller or manipulate the controller (for example, in response to user interaction), the application state and the model are always be kept in sync.</p>
<p>Each controller is a reusable component. It has it’s own hash range from 0 to k-1, where k is the cardinality of the component’s model.</p>
<p>These components assemble together like LEGO® blocks, and no matter what assembly you make with them, the result is still a minimal perfect hash function over the assembly’s state domain.</p>
<p>The algorithm is fast (fast enough for 60hz interaction) and powers my whole framework. Now, I’m having trouble <em>filling</em> the available space.</p>
<p>Leveraging the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain" target="_blank">JavaScript prototype chain</a>, I was able to add object-oriented concepts like inheritance into the equation.</p>
<p>It takes a bit of doing to express an enjoyable user experience numerically but once you have those expressions it is easy to turn them into software components.</p>
<p>What I’ve made so far are a few basic apps which remember where you scroll in each section and include some basic user preferences like light/dark/device mode, theme options, and a menu that remembers where it is in its open/close tween. All of this comes together in a configuration space that demands <em>less than 5 characters</em>. Plus, the domain names I own are relatively short and snappy. Here is what one of my apps looks like in light mode with the menu open (this project is in alpha so these links are subject to break):</p>
<pre>https://core.parts/v0/5</pre>
<p>Here’s the menu closed:</p>
<pre>https://core.parts/v0/3</pre>
<p>Here’s dark mode, menu open:</p>
<pre>https://core.parts/v0/9</pre>
<p>And here’s dark mode with the menu closed:</p>
<pre>https://core.parts/v0/7</pre>
<p>And here is another website in device color mode, the menu open, and scrolled partway down the page:</p>

<p>I feel like these URIs are really small for what they encode. I’m still adding features to the operating system, though, like movable windows, the ability to have arbitrarily many windows open, and even a full read-write file system that behaves in the familiar way. I expect these to start adding length to these hashes.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading! Hopefully, this shows you just how powerful a minimal perfect hash function is when employed for the purposes of data compression. The way that it overlays with MVC architecture is also very satisfying.</p>
<p>I look forward to writing more about the project soon!</p>
