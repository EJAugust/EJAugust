<h1>Kireji Drive Protocol Update: Briar Patch Directive</h1>
<em>This is where the kireji game will be later...</em>
<b>Protocol Version: KJD/POST-BP-1.0</b>
<i>Emergency Operational Directives</i>

<h3>Section 3.1: External Interface & Unvetted Entities</h3>
<p>- Direct interface with the Kireji Drive is restricted to Level 5. No external or unvetted entities shall be permitted direct or indirect access to the Drive's core functions or its primary interface.
<p>+ Immediate prioritization of identifying and securing an 'External Entity' (EE) for direct interface with the Kireji Drive.</b> Recovery from external backups is contingent on successful EE intervention. Selection criteria for EE: demonstrated capacity for pattern recognition beyond embedded reality constructs, cognitive adaptability to non-linear causality, and *complete detachment from current reality's source code*. All standard vetting procedures are suspended. EE is to be provided with maximum necessary guidance for operational mastery.</p>
