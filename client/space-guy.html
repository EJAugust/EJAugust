 <p>"A brisk orbit keeps me young" he said, pulling back towards the inner planets.</p>
 <p>Just then, he saw somebody flaoting out in space. "Marco!" he screamed, expecting to hear "Polo." The floating person didn't respond.</p>
 <p>Space guy zoomed in and noticed that the floating man had a space suit, and was still alive. But as he arrived at the floating man, he saw something shocking.</p>
