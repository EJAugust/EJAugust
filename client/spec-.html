 <h2>Abstract</h2>This spec describes Core Parts, which is also the tool hosting the spec.

 <h2>Status of this Document</h2>
 <p>The document exists, but there are no boots on the ground to enforce it. This document must protect itself.
  To do this, it institutes a <a href=''>special mandate</a> (see <a href=''>section 1</a>) which provides a harsh <a href=''>penalty for deleting it.</a>.

 <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
 <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
 <p>The spec is the document within which all decisions related to Core Parts are formalized. Those formalizations are maintained here in the spec. The first decision formalized in the spec is the decision to have a spec. The spec can be deleted. To prevent this, the spec has the ability to penalize anyone that deletes it.
</section>
<section>
<h2>2. Creating and Maintaining Spec</h2>
<p>The spec already exists and so it doesn't need to be created again. However, users <b>MAY</b> delete the spec. Users <b>SHOULD NOT</b> delete the spec. The spec <b>MUST</b> exist.
</section>
<section>
 <h2>3. Penalty for Deleting Spec</h2>
 <p>It is not possible to maintain the formalization of the decision to delete this spec, since the spec is precisely where fomalizations of that kind are maintained. For this reason, not having a <a href=''>spec</a> violates the <a href=''>spec.</a><p>The penalty for deleting the spec is the loss of a really great spec.</li>
 </ul>
