<h1>Hungry Orbs</h1>
<section><h2>Chapter 1 - "Oh no!"</h2>
<p>"Oh no." said the disappointed orb.
<p>He was disappointed because just below him, there was a much smaller orb which he knew was going to grow in size and eat him.
<p>"Yoink!" said the small orb below him as it grew to his size and ate the bigger orb.
<p>The first orb was now completely gone. The second orb was now the same size, shape, and position as the first. He now <i>was</i> the first orb. Which meant his fate was now the <i>same</i> as the first orb. This was a very disappointing realization.
<p>"Oh no." said the disappointed orb.
<p>"Yoink!" said the small orb below him.

<section><h2>Chapter 2 - "Do something!"</h2>
 <p>The orb from chapter one was just one orb. A tiny, self-eating orb.
 <p>Just above him was a medium orb - much bigger than the tiny orb.
 <p>The medium size orb was mortified to see the tiny orb trapped in a cycle.
 <p>"That could be me!" he cried to an even larger orb up above. "Do something!"
 <p>A booming voice came back in response. "There's nothing I can do."
 <p>"I could fix it if I was you!" cried the middle orb, becaming enraged. He resolved to <i>grow</i>. Gathering all strength, he exploded in size.
 <p>"Yoink!" said the medium orb as it grew to the big orb's size and ate the big orb.</p>
 <p>The biggest orb was now completely gone. The medium orb was now the same size, shape, and position as the biggest. He now <i>was</i> the biggest orb. Which meant his fate was now the <i>same</i> as the biggest orb. This was a very dissapointing realization.
 <p>"Oh no" said the disspointed orb.
 <p>"Yoink!" said the small orb below him.</p>
