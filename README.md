This is a new project that lets you explore the web even when you don't have an internet connection. Imagine a community-made library of multimedia content and tools for browsing, remixing and sharing that content without going online. Kireji is in an early stage of development, but it already allows you to do this with some basic content. We're working on adding more tools and content in the future.
