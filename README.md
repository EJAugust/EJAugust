This repo unites all my personal projects using a frontend framework that I have been developing for years.

Every web app built in this framework offers a permalink to every valid client state, generated automatically. That URL achieves maxmimal compression storing the state of the client application.

This allows offline browsing, editing and sharing.

## [Components](https://github.com/EJAugust/EJAugust#components)
Each web application - and, separately, each datum that makes up the application's state - is a reusable component. Each component is defined as a type. Types and their instances follow the *type lifecycle* and type instances store their state in a maximally compressed way.

## [Type lifecycle](https://github.com/EJAugust/EJAugust#type-lifecycle)
A type is defined by three pairs of lifecycle callbacks:
|Event name|Event trigger
|-|-
|**`install`** and **`uninstall`** (*static*)|called when adding or removing a type
|**`create`** and **`destroy`**|called when adding or removing an instance
|**`emit`** and **`absorb`**|called when propagating changes across instances

Native javascript events interface with these lifecycle events, and the client application is the type whose name is `location.host`.

## [Change propagation](https://github.com/EJAugust/EJAugust#change-propagation)
Using the type lifecycle, a change in any datum propagates to the global state - every datum is an endpoint that drives its dependant data. A polynomial expression gives  hierarchy of types. Every level of the hierarchy is both a single datum and an array of 0 or more data.
