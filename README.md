## About

This is a social platform built on mathematics. Reusable application components are defined using algebra so that polynomial expressions encode all behavior. One polynomial encodes the entire platform.

Math is handled under the hood (in base classes), allowing designers to create rich multimedia content where changes to art assets are automatically propagated to the global polynomial.

This is a permalink engine - the API is a bijection between URL and application state.

This project is in pre-alpha. The API is subject to change.

Demos:

- [kireji.io](https://kireji.io) - Permalinks to all valid English expressions within a given grammar (currently supports a few simple models), allowing them to be shared as messages.
- [glowstick.click](https://glowstick.click) - Streaming platform providing permalinks to every subset (clip) of every video in the library. 2D and 3D animations play in real time rather than as prerendered video.
- More coming soon.
