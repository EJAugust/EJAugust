## About

This is a social platform built on mathematics. Reusable application components are defined using algebra so that polynomial expressions encode all behavior. One polynomial encodes the entire platform.

Math is handled under the hood (in base classes), allowing designers to create rich multimedia content where changes to art assets are automatically propagated to the global polynomial.

This is a permalink engine - the API is a bijection between URL and window state.

This project is in alpha. The API is subject to change.

Live demos:

- [ejaugust.github.io](https://ejaugust.github.io) - A viewer for the source code and spec which is deployed automatically by GitHub from this repo.
- [kireji.io](https://kireji.io) - Permalinks to all valid English expressions within a given grammar (currently supports a few simple models), allowing them to be shared as messages.
- [core.parts](https://core.parts) - Visualize the high-dimensional global state space and focus on individual terms in the global polynomial.
- [ejaugust.com](https://ejaugust.com) - A developer notebook where I talk about, track, and experiment with the math behind the platform.
- [fallback.cloud](https://fallback.cloud) - Coming soon - will create a metaspace allowing developers to "build applications" even though there is already a permalink to every application the system lets them make.
