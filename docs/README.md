# Kireji: Entropy-Perfect Web Applications

**Kireji** is a web-based software platform that compresses application state into the URL using minimal perfect hash functions (MPHFs). It unifies multiple applications under a single, composable, state-addressable architecture.

All applications powered by Kireji are stateless in the traditional sense: their complete state is encoded directly in the URL. This allows for deterministic, lossless deep linking, bookmarking, and historical replay ‚Äî all without cookies, localStorage, or server synchronization.

## Live Applications

You can explore the platform now through these publicly deployed apps:

* [ejaugust.com](https://www.ejaugust.com) ‚Äì a notebook-style blog about the platform
* [desktop.parts](https://www.desktop.parts) ‚Äì a preview of a GUI-based OS experience
* [kireji.app](https://www.kireji.app) ‚Äì an entropy and hash-space explorer for the platform
### Coming Soon

The following apps are not built yet, but their domain names, PWA components and landing pages have been added to the platform:
* [core.parts](https://www.core.parts) ‚Äì likely to become a web-based Universal IDE
* [user.parts](https://www.user.parts) ‚Äì potential editor for software parts
* [glowstick.click](https://www.glowstick.click) ‚Äì purpose TBD
* [kireji.io](https://www.kireji.io) ‚Äì the future gamified UIDE
* [orenjinari.com](https://www.orenjinari.com) ‚Äì example of an artist's portfolio

## üîê Entropy-Perfect Encoding

Each application state is assigned a unique variable-length base64 hash, derived from a bijective minimal perfect hash function. This makes URLs both compact and maximally expressive.

Example:

```
https://www.ejaugust.com/0.126.0/4lb5kAsH_R0Dv_UHg/
```

No duplicate states. No wasted space. No external state storage.

## The Charm: Measuring Entropy

Kireji introduces a unit of information called the **charm**, which measures entropy in terms of URL hash length. Charms reflect both the number of base64 digits and their variable-length structure. The current system's maximum hash length is 18 charms.

---

## MVC + MPHF Architecture

Kireji's architecture overlays Model-View-Controller (MVC) with a piecewise-defined minimal perfect hash function (MPHF):

* Each controller is a stateful component with its own cardinality.
* These components assemble like LEGO blocks, producing a single composite hash.
* JavaScript's prototype chain enables compositional inheritance between components.

---

## DNS-Based Namespacing

Each software component is assigned a name that follows DNS semantics so that a web application's URL (such as "www.ejaugust.com") can be quickly discerned from a runtime reference to one of its components, such as:

```js
_.com.ejaugust.www.notes["1753855231"]
```

`_` is the only global object, which prevents poluting the global namespace while allowing all components to make absolute reference to eachother via the above scheme.

Thanks to the domain names like `"core.parts"` and `"desktop.parts"`, shared components that _all_ apps use have a fitting place to live at runtime:

```js
_.parts.core    // Stores MVC abstracts and MPHF arithmetic
_.parts.desktop // Holds shared system state components
```

## **Technology Stack**

* **JavaScript (ECMAScript)**
* **CSS (Vanilla)**
* **HTML (W3C Standards)**
* **Service Workers for offline support**
* **Serverless-compatible HTML rendering**

## **Zero Dependencies: A Simpler Equation**

`kireji.js` is written entirely with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. No libraries, frameworks, or third-party packages are imported.

> This choice was made to preserve full control over the build output and align closely with web standards - but it also reflects a deeper design philosophy: by writing the system from scratch, every optimization becomes an opportunity to simplify the equation that defines the entire runtime behavior. `kireji.js` can be reasoned about end-to-end, as a self-contained and self-descriptive system.
